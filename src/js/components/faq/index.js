            <h3 className={subHeading}>How can I donate? Are donations tax deductible?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Yes, donations are tax deductible. Our station has 501(c)(3) status, which means the IRS classifies us as a charitable organization. Freeform Portland gratefully accepts donations through <Link className={link} to="/donate">PayPal</Link> or by check. We also love donations of records, CDs and headphones in good and working condition. Our station runs on support from our friends and neighbors and we are grateful for any and all contributions!
